# jasdjames-homework1-develop-assessibility1

## Description 
The purpose of this project was to make the Horiseon page more accessible and more viable using semantic HTML and elements . The project also included some consolidation and renaming CSS elements to make them more semantic as well.  

The process included: 

- Changing generic HTML Divs to more Semantic elements (i.e. Div to Section)
- Changing Div IDs to Semantic tags 
- Changing CSS classes to semantic elements 
- Making the Nav bar more semantic by using "Nav" instead of an ordered list in a div 
- Making similar changes in the CSS 
- Making the CSS more concise and reader friendly 
- Adding Comments to the CSS
- Fixing a broken (misspelled link) in the HTML
- Re-organizing HTML 
- Removing unused classes 
- Overall organization and ordering of the HTML and CSS
- Changed background colors for assessibility
